            <p class="blogQuestion">Short intro</p>
            <p class="blogCopy">Self taught digital product designer. I like pizza, cars, football and dogs. </p>
            <p class="blogQuestion">What do you do for a living?</p>
            <p class="blogCopy">I am a product designer at Toptal Core team. I focus mainly on the talent experience in
                the company. A big passion of mine is also interaction design, how it evolved on mobile/web from being
                this clunky thing to this smooth iOS/Android animations we have.
            </p>
            <p class="blogQuestion">When did you find your passion for Product Design?</p>
            <p class="blogCopy">There were this cool magazines from Austria and Germany that my grandpa always brought
                when he came back from his trips. I always admired how clean and simple they looked, and never
                understood how they made it to look and feel so good with so little. Now I get it. However my
                background is a bit weird, I started doing some manipulations in photoshop, and after I finished High
                School I wanted to get into building websites. I had no idea how to do it but I took the challenge to
                start and learn how to code as I thought this is essential of building it, I spend 1 year trying to
                learn to code. Didnâ€™t enjoy it at all, so I decided to focus fully on design. At that point I had no
                idea I can make a living from design and design thinking.
            </p>

            <p class="blogQuestion">How long have you been doing your craft?</p>
            <p class="blogCopy">
                I have been at Toptal for a little more than a year. Product design fully focused the
                last 3 years.
            </p>
            <p class="blogQuestion">Describe the beginning of your day</p>
            <p class="blogCopy">I usually wake up at around 5. The first thing I do after I get out of bed is to get my
                breakfast out of the fridge. I eat and give my dogs to eat. Take them out on a short walk. At around 6
                I do some meditation and some stretching and I tend to go to the gym around 7. I workout until 8-8:30
                shower and after that I start my work day.

            <p class="blogQuestion">Whatâ€™s your source of inspiration?</p>
            <p class="blogCopy">
                Nature. This has always provided me the biggest source of inspiration. The thing that there is nobody

            <p class="blogCopy">
                Shebah. The impact it made in the community and the traction it got was pretty wonderful and this was
                at a time I started focusing more on building products.

            <p class="blogQuestion">Whatâ€™s your favourite movie?</p>
            <p class="blogCopy">
                Hm, a favourite one is hard to say. I would say Forrest Gump.

            <p class="blogCopy">
                I like all books as you can get something from each one. However a turning book in my life was Think
                and grow rich by Napoleon Hill.

            </p>
            <p class="blogQuestion">What advice would you give to people that start out with product design?</p>
            <p class="blogCopy">
                Donâ€™t rush it. It will take time to get to the stage of a designer you are admiring. Also donâ€™t get
                focused on the numbers on social. Enjoy the process.
            </p>
            <p class="blogQuestion">Have you ever thought of empowering your creative community in any way, shape or
                form?</p>
            <p class="blogCopy">
                I am actually starting a podcast very soon, where I just chit-chat with people from the industry. Hope
                it can empower younger designers.
