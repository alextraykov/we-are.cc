            <p class="blogQuestion">When did you find your passion for design?</p>
            <p class="blogCopy">As a kid I never imagined that I would be into something even remotely related to drawing. I was into astronomy
                and physics at that time and I even graduated a High School of Mathematics and Sciences. As a teenager I
                somehow got into graffiti, then I met Photoshop 7.0 and it changed everything! From there on it was all about
                learning new things, exploring new tools, new software and mediums. Physics became a thing of the past. One
                thing led to another and I ended up working on design projects of different nature.
            </p>
            <p class="blogQuestion">How long have you been doing your craft?</p>
            <p class="blogCopy">Professionally for about 6 years. </p>


            <p class="blogQuestion">Describe the beginning of your day</p>
            <p class="blogCopy"> It all starts with waking up around 8:30. I take a nice cup of coffee and spend the first hour of my day at the
                park with my dog. It consists of being amazed by how coffee works and contemplating on life while picking
                dog poop off the ground. I squeeze in an occasional workout, then I take a shower and rush into the studio
                where all the magic happens.
            </p>
            <p class="blogQuestion">What‚Äôs your workspace?</p>
            <p class="blogCopy">MacbookPro with a 27‚Äù monitor + wireless peripherals (I really hate cables). I prefer a clean, but not too minimal
                desk. I still keep some notepads, memorabilia, a plant or two... maybe a Corgi. </p>
            <img class="blogImage" src="images/nox-workspace.jpeg">
            </p>
            <p class="blogQuestion">What‚Äôs your source of inspiration?</p>
            <p class="blogCopy">Typically getting started with the project and going with the flow works for me. Inspiration comes in many forms.
                I like to leave it build up as I invest myself in the task.</p>
            <!--  -->
            <p class="blogQuestion"> What works are you most proud of?</p>
            <p class="blogCopy">I don‚Äôt have particular favourite, but the "Sneaky Submarine" was a huge game changer for me. Mostly because
                it proved that if I get excited enough about a project, I can make it happen no matter the circumstances.
                At that time these super-polished chunks of ground and water were really popular, but nobody made it move,
                so I decided that I'm going to be the first to do it. I had no idea how to make it happen and I couldn't
                find any tutorials even remotely close to what I was trying accomplish. After a week of pure dedication I
                managed to figure everything out and it became an instant hit on Dribbble. </p>

            <p class="blogQuestion">What are the tools you use in your day to day life?</p>
            <p class="blogCopy">Sketch, After Effects, Abstract, Marvel App, Principle, Cinema 4D, Illustrator</p>

            <p class="blogQuestion">Do you follow any set of principles for your work?</p>
            <p class="blogCopy">Honesty. Quality over quantity. No project is cool enough if there are no good people involved.</p>

            <p class="blogQuestion">What‚Äôs your favourite movie?</p>
            <p class="blogCopy">Can't really point to a particular movie, but I really like the ones that keep me guessing until the end. ü§Ø</p>

            <p class="blogQuestion">What's your favourite book?</p>
            <p class="blogCopy">King Rat by James Clavell</p>

            <p class="blogQuestion">What advice would you give to people that start out with design?</p>
            <p class="blogCopy">Just hang in there. It's not rocket science, but you need persistence. Comfort will kill you slowly, so keep
                exploring and try new things every day. You'll amaze yourself!
            </p>

            <p class="blogQuestion">Have you ever thought of empowering your creative community in any way, shape or form?</p>

            <p class="blogCopy">
                Definitely! In light of that, me along with seven other local designers recently decided to join forces in building an online
                platform for skill sharing and experimentation. Our goal is to support the Bulgarian design community, inspire
                creativity and grow together. And yes, I just copied that from our
                <a href="https://dribbble.com/perspektiva">Dribbble profile description. </a>I‚Äôll keep you posted on our progress!
