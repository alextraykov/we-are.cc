            <p class="blogQuestion">Short intro</p>
            <p class="blogCopy">My name is Alex. When I meet people they usually tell me I look like d'Artagnan or the white Snoop Dogg. Both
                of them are pretty awesome (for different reasons), so I guess I got that going on for me, which is nice.</p>
            <p class="blogQuestion">What do you do for a living?</p>
            <p class="blogCopy">Design. All kinds of it, too. I‚Äôve done everything from brand and print design, through UI/UX for web and mobile,
                to product and game design. I‚Äôve dabbed into fashion design, too. The only type of design I‚Äôve yet to do
                is industrial and interior. For the past 3 years, I‚Äôve been mostly focused on doing Puzl CowOrKing (a.k.a.
                The Best Coworking in CEE) for a living. I spend my time conceptualizing and designing neat web-based apps
                for our company, as well as whatever other visuals we need. However, the curious part is that due to us being
                a startup, I‚Äôve had to expand my skill-set beyond just design and I‚Äôm now also actively doing product ownership
                and management, business strategy, copywriting and the occasional sales tour. üòÑ </p>

            </p>
            <p class="blogQuestion">When did you find your passion for design?</p>
            <p class="blogCopy">Two things ignited the passion in me. First, when I was 13 I used to spend a lot of time playing games on my
                PC. One Sunday my father came home and said to me ‚ÄúBoy, there‚Äôs so much more that you can do on a PC than
                just playing games.‚Äù and then he showed me Adobe Photoshop 5.5. I spent the next couple of hours doing what
                every person who has just discovered Photoshop does - I opened three photos from the Windows XP library and
                applied every fucking art filter in PS. Artistic Cutout? Check. Sumi-e brush stroke? Check. Glowing edges?
                Hell yeah. Second, when I was 14 I joined the Private Vocational School for Multimedia Computer Graphic Design
                & Animation (It sounds even more ridiculous in Bulgarian, trust me), which was amazing as I got to actually
                learn stuff like Photoshop, Illustrator, 3ds Max and Flash in school. I also had some amazing professionals
                for teachers, most notably Stefan Tchakarov who introduced me to the wonders of brand design, logomarks and
                logotypes.
            </p>
            <p class="blogQuestion">How long have you been doing your craft?</p>
            <p class="blogCopy">I got my first client project when I was 16, so I guess I‚Äôve been doing design for about 9 years. Heh, almost
                a decade.</p>
            <p class="blogQuestion">Describe the beginning of your day</p>
            <p class="blogCopy"> have 3 alarms. If they don‚Äôt wake me up, my girlfriend takes it upon herself to kick me out of bed. I then proceed
                to read daily world news and facepalm myself multiple times, while I wait my girlfriend to get ready. We
                go out together, pass by a small coffee place to grab a latte, an espresso and two croissants (their butter
                and cheddar one is to die for), and then proceed to play tetris with the rest of the people who are trying
                to get on the metro.
            </p>
            <p class="blogQuestion">What‚Äôs your workspace?</p>
            <p class="blogCopy">Well, if there‚Äôs one benefit of working for and at a coworking space, it‚Äôs that I have more than 6,000 m2 to
                work from. Basically, I don‚Äôt have a desk. I‚Äôve worked from at least 16 different ones and it feels great,
                because every month or two I just decide to switch up things.</p>
            <img class="blogImage" src="images/tok-workspace.jpeg">
            </p>
            <p class="blogQuestion">What‚Äôs your source of inspiration?</p>
            <p class="blogCopy">Books. Especially books that are not about design. Also,
                <a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/">http://waitbutwhy.com/</a>. Travel as well. Visiting another country/city and exploring its everyday design
                language is a big one. Going somewhere new and seeing how their street posters look, how they communicate
                their public transport, how small and medium businesses brand themselves - it‚Äôs super exciting. Also, everything
                Hayao Miyazaki has ever produced.</p>

            <p class="blogQuestion"> What works are you most proud of?</p>
            <p class="blogCopy">I‚Äôve been doing this for 9 years. I‚Äôve been proud of different things at different times of my career. When I
                was 18, I was very proud of this t-shirt design I did for a deviantART contest:
            </p>
            <img class="blogImage" src="images/tok-photo1.png">
            <p class="blogCopy">At 20, I was super proud of a website I designed, which won some awards (the front-end dev wanted to slit my
                throat):
            </p>
            <img class="blogImage" src="images/tok-photo2.jpeg">
            <p class="blogCopy">Then I spent a couple of years being proud of work I could never show, because of silly Non-Disclosure Agreements.
                Now I‚Äôm proud of everything we‚Äôre doing in Puzl, but mostly of putting silly shit like transparent .GIFs
                and a whole adventure game on our new website -

            </p>
            <img class="blogImage" src="images/tok-image3.gif">

            <p class="blogQuestion">What are the tools you use in your day to day life?</p>
            <p class="blogCopy">Webflow. Webflow. Webflow. It has changed my life. There is no better tool for doing web/mobile/product design.
                It‚Äôs everything I‚Äôve ever wanted as a UI/UX designer. I still open Photoshop and Illustrator when I need
                to retouch a photo or quickly edit an .SVG, but this happens maybe two-three times a month, tops.</p>
            <p class="blogQuestion">Do you follow any set of principles for your work?</p>
            <p class="blogCopy">Make it useable. Make it simple. Aesthetics without ethics is just cosmetics.</p>
            <p class="blogQuestion">What‚Äôs your favourite movie?</p>
            <p class="blogCopy">Anything ever made by Hayao Miyazaki. Also, The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring.</p>
            <p class="blogQuestion">What's your favourite book?</p>
            <p class="blogCopy">Anything ever written by Guy Gavriel Kay, but mostly The Lions of Al-Rassan.</p>
            <p class="blogQuestion">What advice would you give to people that start out with design?</p>
            <p class="blogCopy">If you are not designing it for yourself/your business, DO NOT emotionally invest yourself in the design. You‚Äôll
                only suffer.
            </p>
            <p class="blogQuestion">Have you ever thought of empowering your creative community in any way, shape or form?</p>
            <p class="blogCopy">
                I‚Äôve occasionally helped out
                <a href="https://www.facebook.com/fillandstrokedesign/">Fill & Stroke</a> with their Show & Tell events and Design Battles. I‚Äôve also tried my best to guide young/starting
                designers, advise them and help them find a place to work where they can grow and their talent will be nurtured.
