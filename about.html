            <p class="blogQuestion">Short intro</p>
            <p class="blogCopy">Isn't this awkward. I'm interviewing myself. I'll change up the questions so you could
                get a better sense of
                what and why am I doing this.</p>
            <p class="blogQuestion">What's your exact idea behind "we-are"?</p>
            <p class="blogCopy">Three years ago an idea came up right after I left the hall of the design event I
                attended. "I enjoy meeting
                people in general. What if I interview the creatives that might not be the self-proclaimed 'famous'
                design
                gurus in our community but are as talented, dedicated and hardworking as all of the well know good
                designers
                around the world‚Äù. From then on my search began. I was lucky enough to meet great, hard working, humble
                creators/makers
                from Bulgaria and around the world. So I thought "Maybe it would be nice if everyone who‚Äôs interested
                could
                be able to virtually meet them as well".
                <p class="blogQuestion">What were the challenges you encountered in the creation of "we-are"?</p>
                <p class="blogCopy">Self-doubt. Even though the feedback I got for this project was overwhelmingly
                    positive I still thought I
                    wouldn't be able to ship it. The other thing was finding the balance in the questions. I wanted
                    them
                    to be thought-provoking, yet easy and pleasant for the interviewees. That took a while.
                </p>
                <p class="blogQuestion">Can you tell us more about yourself?</p>
                <p class="blogCopy">Sure thing, Alex. üëàüëà üòé My name is Alexander Traykov and I'm born raised and
                    based in Sofia, Bulgaria.
                    I get inspired the most by product design, but I'm focusing on digital product design. My other
                    interests
                    (outside of work) are martial arts, mindfulness and cognitive psychology (gatekeepers beware, I
                    enjoy
                    reading about our brain, yet I'm no scientist, don't crucify me). Oh and I've got a thing about
                    tiny
                    cute animals, they just melts my heart.

                </p>
                <p class="blogQuestion">What are you trying to achieve with a project like this?</p>
                <p class="blogCopy">I try to raise awareness for the people that I feature here. Nothing more, nothing
                    less. I'm working on another
                    project with the lovely Fill & Stroke team, where we organize both design events and design battles
                    in
                    Sofia, Bulgaria.
                </p>
                <p class="blogQuestion">Where can I get more info about you?</p>
            </p>
            <p class="blogCopy">You can follow me on my socials - that'd be lovely </p>
