            <h1 class="blogTitle">Kalina Ivanova üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà</h1>
            <p class="blogSubtitle">Product Designer &amp; Illustrator</p>
        </div>
        <p class="blogQuestion">Short intro</p>
        <p class="blogCopy">My name is Kalina and I‚Äôm a queer designer and overall nerd based in Sofia. I love my cats, mountains, sci fi, comics
            and overanalyzing.
        </p>
        <p class="blogQuestion">What do you do for a living?</p>
        <p class="blogCopy">I‚Äôm a product design and illustrator with a strong interest in design systems and inclusivity in design. </p>
        <p class="blogQuestion">When did you find your passion for illustration?</p>
        <p class="blogCopy">
            If I had to pick a certain point in time, probably 5 years ago, while designing the website for my first agency, but it was
            more of a gradual process instead of an ‚Äúaha‚Äù moment.
        </p>
        <p class="blogQuestion">For how long have you been a designer?</p>
        <p class="blogCopy">
            I‚Äôve worked in the design industry for the past 6 years.
        </p>
        <p class="blogQuestion">
            Describe the beginning of your day
        </p>
        <p class="blogCopy">I usually wake up a few minutes before my alarm and I cuddle with my cat in bed. I shower first thing when I get
            out of bed and I make some breakfast (usually homemade granola and yogurt). I check social media and news while
            drinking my coffee and then I meditate. After that I‚Äôll either try to squeeze in a workout or I get to work.
        </p>
        <p class="blogQuestion">What‚Äôs your workspace?</p>
        <p class="blogCopy">
            I have always worked from home and I absolutely love it. My sitting desk and chair are from IKEA and I‚Äôm planning to upgrade
            to one of their standing desks soon. </p>
        <img class="blogImage" src="images/kalina-workspace.jpg">

        <p class="blogQuestion">What‚Äôs your source for inspiration?</p>
        <p class="blogCopy">
            I don‚Äôt like to think in terms of inspiration when it comes to my work. I use research and reference to make informed choices.
        </p>
        <p class="blogQuestion"> What works are you most proud of?</p>
        <p class="blogCopy">
            I‚Äôm honored and humbled to have worked on a software platform for online testing that‚Äôs used by NATO and the US DoD. It was
            a very challenging process in terms of security and accommodating users with different levels of tech savvy.
        </p>
        <p class="blogQuestion">What are the tools you use in your day to day life?</p>
        <p class="blogCopy">
            I use Affinity Designer for illustration and icon design. I‚Äôm currently transitioning from Sketch to Figma for product and
            I also use Webflow for web design and simple prototyping. Todoist is my all-time favourite to-do/list management
            app and Paper is my go to for documentation and notes. I also jump between online tools for accounting and finances,
            but I don‚Äôt have a strong opinion on a specific one.

        </p>
        <p class="blogQuestion">Do you follow any set of principles for your work?</p>
        <p class="blogCopy">
            I believe every profession is the algorithmic application of a set of principles, so as a working person, I do follow one
            myself.
        </p>
        <p class="blogQuestion">
            What‚Äôs your favourite movie?
        </p>
        <p class="blogCopy">
            The Matrix, all three movies.
        </p>
        <p class="blogQuestion">
            What‚Äôs your favourite book?
        </p>
        <p class="blogCopy">
            The Dark Tower saga by Stephen King.
        </p>
        <p class="blogQuestion">
            What advice would you give to people that start out with Product Design and Illustration?
        </p>
        <p class="blogCopy">
            Drink a lot of water, get a good night‚Äôs sleep every night, take care of your mental health and always remember you‚Äôre just
            a human trying to do something useful for other humans.
        </p>
        <p class="blogQuestion">
            Have you ever thought of empowering your creative community in any way, shape or form?
        </p>
        <p class="blogCopy">
            I do my best to help others in the design community, especially newcomers and underrepresented people. I volunteer for OOOH
            and a few similar orgs and I‚Äôm always happy and willing to participate in and signal boost any initiative helping
            women, NB people, POC, LGBTQ+, immigrants, people with disabilities and other underprivileged groups.
