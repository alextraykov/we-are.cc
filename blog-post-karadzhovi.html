        <p class="blogCopy">
            <span class="mihaela">M:</span>I grew up in a very artistic atmosphere and i was surrounded every day by art and music thanks to my
            parents. My dad took care for the music as a musician, and my mom bought us the best illustrated books and animated
            movies on a film. And as people say the first 7 years are the most important , i guess that was the begining
            of it . Even though i started drawing more serious pretty late - during my school years.
        </p>
        <p class="blogCopy">
            <span class="borislava">B:</span>When I was little I wanted to draw illustrations, but for a long time I couldnâ€™t find my style. Even
            now I canâ€™t call it style. But itâ€™s something people knows me with so I guess iâ€™m on the right way.
        </p>

        <p class="blogCopy">
            <span class="mihaela">M:</span>I I started drawing in the kindergarten as all young fellas , but the serious stuff came when i was
            in 5th grade - that was the time when i was put on the basics of drawing and painting . Illustration came a little
            bit later - when i got to study in National Academy of Arts in Sofia , Bulgaria for my BA degree in 2012.

                Yes, i've been thinking about it ,lately. I was thinking about what brings illustrators together and what we can do to make
                the society of illustrators from all around the globe unified. Illustration Festival here in Bulgaria would
                be a super great start! Like a festival that includes not only lectures of illustrators from all around the
                world, but a drawing class with them , workshops, talking about the fun stuff in our jobs ... something that
                is super chill , not pressured by " talk serious and do serious stuff because life is serious". It's all
                about the fun!
