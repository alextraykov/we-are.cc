                my bike has it’s own name).</p>

            <p class="blogQuestion">What do you do for a living?</p>
            <p class="blogCopy">My work is an interesting mixture of different elements. I work in Four Plus studio as a graphic designer with
                focus on Visual identity, Lettering and Calligraphy and in my free time I’m a freelance Papercraft artist.

            <!-- Passion -->
            <p class="blogQuestion">When did you find your passion for papercraft and design?</p>
            <p class="blogCopy">When I was little I loved to draw and make things. After I started studying in the National Academy of Art I
                found all of my passions (graphic design, calligraphy and paper craft). I graduated with a BA degree in Advertising
                design and a MA degree in Calligraphy. My love for papercraft started after my participation in Arjowiggins
                Second Skin Contest. The task was to create a mask entirely made out of paper. I was up for a challenge and
                I gave it a try.

            <p class="blogCopy">I wake up between 7.30-8.00. I get up, make coffee and breakfast, do some yoga, check my Instagram feed and at
                9.00 I’m off to work with Bicicletta. Riding my bike to work gives me the time to think and plan the rest
                of my day.

            <!--Most proud of-->
            <p class="blogQuestion">What works are you most proud of??</p>
            <p class="blogCopy">Probably, my MA degree project - Strokes, Shapes & Light. I worked on it for a year and it was an interesting
                experiment combining calligraphy, papercraft and photography. The project is a spatial design study of basic
                calligraphy techniques, interpreted by papercraft models. Each paper model is based on the trace, pressure
                and gesture of writing with a particular calligraphic tool. The result is a series of photographs combining
                interesting mixtures of structures, volumes and light. I was really happy when I found out that my project
                was among the winners in the 2018 Typography Competition by
