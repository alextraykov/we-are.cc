            <p class="blogQuestion">Short intro</p>
            <p class="blogCopy">My name is Boris, I am a motion designer with interest in production.</p>
            <img class="blogImage" src="images/boris-dots-gif.gif">
            <p class="blogQuestion">When did you find your passion for motion and animation?</p>
            <p class="blogCopy">After my graduation I started exploring different softwares to find a proper tool to express my passions, I ended
                up loving animations and motion, so I continue to pursue and improve my skills in that direction.</p>
            <p class="blogQuestion">How long have you been doing motion and animation?</p>
            <p class="blogCopy">Actively about two years.</p>
            <img class="blogImage" src="images/boris-gif2.gif">
            <p class="blogQuestion">Describe the beginning of your day</p>
            <p class="blogCopy">I brew some coffee and make a quick 30 minute scan of my favourite websites. Also I use Flickr so I get deep
                there from time to time making it more then 30 minutes.</p>
            <img class="blogImage" src="images/boris-photo-cat.jpeg">
            <p class="blogQuestion">What’s your workspace?</p>
            <p class="blogCopy">At home anything could be a workspace, wherever my laptop is - it’s a workspace for me. At work I’m really trying
                to keep a clean desk, minding that minimalism is the new cool thing, but honestly I really like surrounding
                myself with memorabilia, plants and books I never read, but I think I would.Sometimes I buy books just for
                the cover aesthetics and I’m not even ashamed of that.</p>

            <p class="blogQuestion">What’s your source of inspiration?</p>
            <p class="blogCopy">Mainly I get inspiration from nature and animals. It is awesome that everything that is already designed or thought
                of is perfectly done in what is surrounding us, I am not speaking about man made stuff. You can find visual,
                structural or informational patterns in nature. Like for example one of the last animations I did I needed
                to find a proper color palette to express warmth, security and confidence at the same time so I got the colors
                from a Puffin bird. They are crazy. living on edgy rocks in big colonies, taking care of their families and
                diving into deep water to get some food. Crazy fellas and so beautiful. </p>

            <p class="blogQuestion"> What works are you most proud of?</p>
            <p class="blogCopy">I took a part of a small team for the construction of a website.
                <a href="www.teahousesofia.com/shop">www.teahousesofia.com/shop</a> - they have two tea houses in Sofia and offer some of the best herbs and spices
                for a hot cup of water. I took part in the photography, and we ended up taking photos of more than 100 different
                type of teas. Also me and some friends just started a photoblog type of website, which is epic.
