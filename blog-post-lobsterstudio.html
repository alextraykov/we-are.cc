            <p class="blogCopy">
                <span class="lobster1">N:</span> I remember when I was graduating university, I really couldn’t imagine myself as an animator. I
                didn’t want to be in front of a computer all the time. I was in an acting class and loved being among people.
                Also I didn’t have any great experience with animation and I couldn’t imagine that one day I can do that
                for living. It’s a hard, hard work. But somehow I got really motivated just after I graduated, and started
                to experiment a lot and began to constantly learn new things. I still do, and I enjoy it the same way.
            </p>
            <p class="blogCopy">
                <span class="lobster2">P:</span>I’ve always enjoyed animation. Ever since I was a little kid I wanted to be an animator and I just
                stuck with it and never really considered doing anything else.
            </p>
            <p class="blogCopy">
                <span class="lobster3">T:</span>My initial dream was to become an architect, but suddenly I realised that there is too much restrictions
                in the architecture field and that I wanted to make things that are beyond all possibilities. So when I did
                my first moving frames that was it!

            <p class="blogCopy">
                <span class="lobster1">N:</span> It’s been 6 years professionally + 4 years in University. In fact I had my first contact with animation
                when I was around 14. I did my very first animation movie on MS Paint, drawed it with the mouse, and composited
                it in Movie Maker. It was really cool to do it, even though I am sure it was terrible result imagining it
                now. Unfortunately my hard drive died soon after and I lost my first film.. : ( Animation is incredibly versatile,
                and if you really enjoy it you don’t feel the time passing. I can say that animation teached me to being
                really patient.

                a walk. After I walk the dog I take a quick shower and by that time I’m probably already late for work, so
                I rush to the office pretty winded and the work day begins.

                as I find them fun to give life to. Another source for me are animals. I do animate animals very often. At
                the time I take break from work I gather some ideas from experiences and places.

            <p class="blogCopy">
                <span class="lobster1">N:</span> Must be highly motivated to do it. Animation is not a job. You must love it in order to be able
                to do it good. Be prepared for long hours of work, and sure fun. There is a lot of work in the animation
                area at the moment, so I’d suggest everyone that is interested to give a try and see for himself it that’s
                what makes him happy. Never stop to improve.


            </p>
            <p class="blogCopy">
                <span class="lobster2">P:</span>Don’t do it. The chances that you’ll make a decent living out of this are very slim. Just give up
                while there’s still time and find a real job.

            </p>
            <p class="blogCopy">
                <span class="lobster3">T:</span> When you are a beginner you have to draw a lot, every day. You have to observe and exaggerate reality
                in your work. It is crucial to learn the basics of frame by frame animation in order to overcome all limitations
                and create something out of the box. You have to work almost like a slave to be able to experience the joy
                of seeing a drawing come to life. I think that’s what makes animation so awesome!
