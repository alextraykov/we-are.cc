            <p class="blogSubtitle">Front-End & UX Developer</p>
        </div>
        <p class="blogQuestion">Short intro</p>
        <p class="blogCopy">Hi, I'm Kristjan. I get a kick out of animations/interactions and building cool UI. I have a thing for lots of things.
        </p>
        <p class="blogQuestion">What do you do for a living?</p>
        <p class="blogCopy">I build cool shit (at least I think so). I'm a front-end/UX developer. I mostly build UI, work on (micro)interactions,
            animations and sometimes some people ask me to do some UX work.</p>
        <p class="blogQuestion">When did you find your passion to develop?</p>
        <p class="blogCopy">
            Probably in high school. I think it was in the 10th grade when a classmate needed a website, and as we all are as teenagers,
            I was hella' confident and said I could do it. I mean, I actually couldn't, but how hard could it be, right?
            10 days of Googling later I actually managed to put a website together, it was shit, but it existed. From that
            point on I fell in love with building UI's.
        </p>
        <p class="blogQuestion">For how long have you been a developer?</p>
        <p class="blogCopy">Professionally? I guess around five years, but I really started to feel like I'm going somewhere with this after
            I joined Swipes. So my answer will be 2.5 years.

        </p>
        <p class="blogQuestion">For how long have you been illustrating?</p>
        <p class="blogCopy">Professionally Iâ€™ve been a product illustrator for about an year.</p>
        <p class="blogQuestion">
            Describe the beginning of your day
        </p>
        <p class="blogCopy">Oh god, people, don't judge me. Now that I work from home I get out of bed at around 11 even though I wake up at
            7. I spend three hours in bed reading (not books, more like reddit), watching youtube and being the lazy piece
            of shit that I am. My day starts with me giving time for myself, I don't really work well within strict schedule,
            I do better work when I feel motivated (which sometimes is late at night), but otherwise I don't force myself
            to work.</p>
        <p class="blogQuestion">Whatâ€™s your workspace?</p>
        <p class="blogCopy">Currently my bed mostly, it's really cold in Estonia and I love my blanket.</p>
        <img class="blogImage" src="images/kris-workspace.jpeg">
        <p class="blogMicrocopy">*Alex made me clean my desk and show it to you*</p>
        <p class="blogQuestion">Whatâ€™s your source for inspiration?</p>
        <p class="blogCopy">Other people's work. So often I see something so incredibly pretty that I have to put everything on hold to bounce
            ideas of that and create something of my own.

        </p>
        <p class="blogQuestion"> What works are you most proud of?</p>
        <p class="blogCopy">Huh, that's a hard one. I don't think I'm proud of something specific. It's more like I'm proud of myself every time
            I finish something, when I see the result of my work. Sometimes it feels so surreal to be able to build products,
            or even just like a button, from scratch.. myself.. it's crazy.
        </p>

        <p class="blogQuestion">What are the tools you use in your day to day life?</p>
        <ul class="blogCopy">
            <li>
                <a href="https://codepen.io/">https://codepen.io/</a> - for all of that yummy prototyping.</li>
            <li>
                <a href="https://bennettfeely.com/clippy/">https://bennettfeely.com/clippy/</a> - because I can never remember how to build clip-path</li>
            <li>
                <a href="https://webgradients.com/">https://webgradients.com/</a>
                - because I like gradients and there's loads of them.
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="http://www.agenciesranked.com/createcss3/">http://www.agenciesranked.com/createcss3/</a> - because itâ€™s faster than prototyping sometimes.</li>
            <p>
                My go to code editor at the moment is Sublime Text 3 and I guess I use terminal on a daily basis. For on the fly image editing
                I use GIMP (don't ask why, I've used it for like 7 years now and I just know how it works + it's fast). For
                viewing designs it's either Invision or Zeplin.

            </p>
            </p>
            <p class="blogQuestion">Do you follow any set of principles for your work?</p>
            <p class="blogCopy">I'm not sure if they are principles per se, but I have some things.</p>
            <ul class="principles">
                <li>If you're not motivated to work, don't work. I will never be able to do my best work when I'm just not in
                    that zone.
                </li>
                <li>If you can't solve a problem take a nap. The best ideas seem to come to me when I'm doing something else
                    and letting my brain rest.</li>
                <li>Test your shit on other people. I tend to have skewed ideas of how people interact with products, and I forget
                    that most people aren't as tech savvy. Especially when prototyping experimental interaction.</li>
                <li>Try to be a nice person.</li>
                <li>No one has ever died from a two oâ€™clock mojito</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="blogQuestion">Whatâ€™s your favourite movie?</p>
            <p class="blogCopy">Is it too lame if I say Deadpool? I mean, my other answer would be No Strings Attached. Not sure which one makes
                me look less cool.</p>
            <p class="blogQuestion">What's your favourite book?</p>
            <p class="blogCopy">I will probably never get over Harry Potter, it has shaped so much of who I am. I've read all of the books at
                least 7 times, some more. I would follow this up with Eragon. As you can probably tell I like young-adult
                fantasy books. I don't think I've ever read any non-fiction, sue me.</p>
            <p class="blogQuestion">What advice would you give to people that start out with Front End Development?</p>
            <p class="blogCopy">Honestly? Just do it. Start doing things, be excited, ask questions.</p>
            <p class="blogQuestion">Have you ever thought on empowering your creative community in any way, shape or form?</p>
            <p class="blogCopy">Yes, but outside of codepen community I haven't really done much. I mean, I did a codepen event in Sofia, three
                people showed up, thanks guys.
            </p>
            <p class="thankYou">Thank you for your time and honesty Kris,I love the slight comedic vibe of your interview.</p>
