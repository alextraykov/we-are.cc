            <p class="blogQuestion">Short intro</p>
            <p class="blogCopy">
                First of all big thanks for the interview man! I think this sentence describes me the
                best. My name is Gil Huybrecht, iâ€™m a designer, skateboarder and (online) teacher. I love everything
                about design with a passion. Iâ€™m also a big animal lover and iâ€™m a huge Friends & How i met your mother
                fan haha.
            </p>
            <p class="blogQuestion">What do you do for a living?</p>
            <p class="blogCopy">I work full time at a branding agency called Ollie in Ghent, Belgium. At ollie iâ€™m
                responsible for anything creative, so i wear a lot of hats. Everything from identity design to
                websites. I really like the variety the job has. Besides that I also freelance after hours for
                businesses and agencies all over the world and I also have some classes on Skillshare which iâ€™m really
                proud of, it was a big step for me, getting on camera etc but i couldnâ€™t be happier that i did it. In
                the future i want to continue sharing knowledge through courses, free content, etc. But first I need to
                focus on renovating me and my girlfriendâ€™s house that we just bought, super cool learning about
                construction.
            </p>

            <p class="blogQuestion">When did you find your passion for design?</p>
            <p class="blogCopy">I was always interested in the graphic design scene, I started a high school studying
                graphic design, this was mostly learning illustrator, indesign & photoshop. When i started college i
                still wasnâ€™t sure what i wanted to do. In my first year at college there was a guy in my class that was
                doing all kinds of skeumorphic designs and that really got me fascinated. I started downloading PSD
                fils from websites like 365 PSD and started digging in the layerstyles and thatâ€™s kind of how my
                passion for webdesign started. After that identity design quickly follow because i really liked doing
                complete projects instead of only the web part. </p>
            <p class="blogQuestion">How long have you been doing design?</p>
            <p class="blogCopy">
                I started freelancing in college so i think I can see I'm â€˜officiallyâ€™ doing it for 6 years or so.
            </p>

            <p class="blogQuestion">Describe the beginning of your day</p>
            <p class="blogCopy">
                My typical weekday consist of getting out of bed at around 7am, feeding our animals, talking a shower
                and eating breakfast (I love breakfast). After that I leave for work, i have to drive 45min to work so
                iâ€™m almost always listen to a good podcast about design or business. When i arrive at work i try to do
                my emails first to get that out of way. Sometimes when i have to do a big chunk of design work I try
                to that first before checking my email. Email can really drain the creativity for me, especially when
                itâ€™s like 20 emails with small to doâ€™s haha.
            </p>
            <p class="blogQuestion">Whatâ€™s your workspace?</p>
            <img class="blogImage" src="images/gil-workspace.jpeg">
            </p>
            <p class="blogQuestion">Whatâ€™s your source of inspiration?</p>
            <p class="blogCopy">
                Inspiration can come from anywhere really for me. It can be simply from dribbble or behance but i can
                be from going out and skating. I also like editorial, magazine design and that also inspires me
                sometimes. Fashion is also a great source of inspiration.
            </p>
            <p class="blogQuestion"> What works are you most proud of?</p>
            <p class="blogCopy">For the last year the 2 projects iâ€™m most proud of is the Ark-Shelter project and Zet.
                The Ark-Shelter website is launching in a couple of weeks, iâ€™m really stoked on that!
            </p>
            <p class="blogQuestion">What are the tools you use in your day to day life?</p>
            <p class="blogCopy">Sketch, Photoshop, Principle, After Effects, Premiere pro, Illustrator, Spotify and
                Slack.</p>

            <p class="blogQuestion">Do you follow any set of principles for your work?</p>
            <p class="blogCopy">
                I donâ€™t really follow any set of principles really. I do find it really important to
                define goals for the project. Letâ€™s say iâ€™m doing a website, iâ€™ll first do a meeting with the client
                where weâ€™ll define the primary goal and the secondary goals for the project. Defining what would be
                project success together with the client is also really important. </p>
            <img class="blogImage" src="images/gil-image3.gif">
            <p class="blogQuestion">Whatâ€™s your favourite movie?</p>
            <p class="blogCopy">
                There are so many good movies haha. I like most of Quentin Tarantinoâ€™s work. Django unchained and
                Inglourious Basterds are my favourites. I also love all the Star wars movies and all the Harry Potter
                movies and the new Fantastic beasts ones. Iâ€™m probably forgetting a lot of others but there are just to
                many good ones haha.</p>

            <p class="blogQuestion">What's your favourite book?</p>
            <p class="blogCopy">
                Iâ€™m not that much of reader but I'm trying to read more in 2019. A really good book business wise is
                Zag from Marty Neumeier. Iâ€™m now ready Scramble, itâ€™s a business book about agile strategy but itâ€™s
                written as a thriller. Supercool read.
            </p>

            <p class="blogQuestion">What advice would you give to people that start out with design? </p>
            <p class="blogCopy">
                I would say try and not be overwhelmed. Try to get good at visual design first, when you are good at
                that, start learning about UX design, after that you could learn about business & strategy. Depends on
                what your interests are but thatâ€™s the way it went for me. Also, enjoy failure, when you fail donâ€™t be
                like â€˜iâ€™m never gonna be good at thisâ€™, see it as a chance to learn something from it. You should see
                me first designs. ðŸ˜…
            </p>
            <img class="blogImage" src="images/gil-image4.gif">
            <p class="blogQuestion">Have you ever thought of empowering your creative community in any way, shape or
                form?</p>
            <p class="blogCopy">
                For sure! I want to continue doing the courses and in the future Iâ€™m probably gonna try out doing a
                newsletter (good chance for me to learn more about copywriting). Giving back to the community is really
                what motivates me, that and seeing business grow through the power of design are 2 things I really
                love!
