            <p class="blogQuestion">Short intro</p>
            <p class="blogCopy">I`m Alexander, a Logo and Identity designer with interest in everything visual. Born and raised in Rousse. Currently
                work and live in Sofia.</p>
            <p class="blogQuestion">What do you do for a living?</p>
            <p class="blogCopy">Making visual design. My current focus is crafting logo design and brand identities for various businesses large

            <img class="blogImage" src="images/alex-photo1.jpg">
            <p class="blogQuestion">When did you find your passion for logo design and branding?</p>
            <p class="blogCopy">Somehow it came naturally for me. Graduated the Rousse high school of Fine Arts in the late 2004. Think that
                back then I have developed my interest for visual arts and design. Later in the university I started my first
                design job in small publishing house in Plovdiv. Doing mainly book covers and magazines design. After a few
                years I left my job and became a freelance designer and never look back :) In the early freelance days I
                was doing pretty much everything: from print design to illustration and websites. After a while, decided
                that my work should be more focused and find out my passion for logo design. </p>
            <p class="blogQuestion">How long have you been doing your craft?</p>
            <p class="blogCopy">I`m doing mainly logo design and brand identities from around four years.</p>

            <p class="blogQuestion">Describe the beginning of your day</p>
            <p class="blogCopy">Coffee - maybe first thing in the morning, then a short walk with our dog. Around 10:00 I get to work.</p>

            </p>
            <p class="blogQuestion">What’s your source of inspiration?</p>
            <p class="blogCopy">Not really. Inspiration comes spontaneously. Everything could be inspiring with the right mindset.</p>
            <p class="blogQuestion"> What works are you most proud of?</p>
            <p class="blogCopy">Usually I'm too critical to my work. Going through my portfolio I feel satisfied with this parrot design.

            <p class="blogQuestion">Have you ever thought of empowering your creative community in any way, shape or form?</p>
            <p class="blogCopy">
                Yes, actually a while ago we discussed this with a group of another seven Bulgarian designers. How we can help the Bulgarian
                design community to grow. The project is still in stealth mode until launch, but hopefully soon it will be
                a reality.
