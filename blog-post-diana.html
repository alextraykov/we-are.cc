            </div>
            <p class="blogQuestion">Short intro</p>
            <p class="blogCopy">I'm an illustrator, I draw, sketch and I’m deeply involved in visualizing difficult content in a way that anyone
                (even your grandma) could wrap their minds around. In general I make information easier to perceive by using
                close to home metaphors and references that should look cool and pretty.</p>
            <img class="blogImage" src="images/diana-adventurer.png">
            <p class="blogQuestion">When did you find your passion for illustration?</p>
            <p class="blogCopy">Never had to go looking for it, it has always been something that I’ve been doing since an early age. I wouldn’t
                call it passion for drawing, I’d call it a way of perceiving everything that’s happening around you. I think
                it has to do with associative thinking, combining you visual perceptions with your analytic ones.</p>
            <p class="blogQuestion">How long have you been illustrating?</p>
            <p class="blogCopy">Professionally I’ve been a product illustrator for about an year.</p>
            <p class="blogQuestion">Describe the beginning of your day</p>
            <p class="blogCopy">I’m a creature of the night, that’s when I’m most proactive, so early mornings for me could be very unproductive.
                To get my brain started I usually listen to podcasts in the morning, I check my emails and go over my plans
                for the day and make sure I haven’t missed an important call or appointment.</p>
            <p class="blogQuestion">What’s your workspace?</p>
            <p class="blogCopy">At home anything could be a workspace, wherever my laptop is - it’s a workspace for me. At work I’m really trying
                to keep a clean desk, minding that minimalism is the new cool thing, but honestly I really like surrounding
                myself with memorabilia, plants and books I never read, but I think I would.Sometimes I buy books just for
                the cover aesthetics and I’m not even ashamed of that.</p>
            <img class="blogImage" src="images/didi-workspace.jpg">
            <p class="blogQuestion">What’s your source of inspiration?</p>
            <p class="blogCopy">Recently I’ve developed the ‘Pinterest Mom” syndrome, but there is an amazing illustrative inspiration there.
                Besides that I’m a big old-school Disney and Cartoon Network fan, but the studio Ghibli aesthetics are the
                ones everyone should dive into.</p>

            <p class="blogQuestion"> What works are you most proud of?</p>
            <img class="blogImage" src="images/diana-tulips.png">
            <p class="blogCopy">I’m proud of all of the work I’ve done because I’ve never imagined I could actually benefit in any way from my
                illustrations, at least not in the scale it has been growing the past year. I’ve always loved what I’ve created
                and never been insecure or ashamed of it, so every new illustration that pops out is a new personal favorite,
                haha.
            </p>
            <p class="blogQuestion">What are the tools you use in your day to day life?</p>
            <p class="blogCopy">I use a mouse, a tablet, a tablet pen, keyboard and when it’s a very very special assignment - a pencil to sketch
                it out first.</p>
            <img class="blogImage" src="images/diana-cosy-pupper.png">
            <p class="blogQuestion">Do you follow any set of principles for your work?</p>
            <p class="blogCopy">Yes, a couple.</p>
            <ul class="principles">
                <li>Don’t go past a deadline, it gives off a bad impression, or at least inform your partners in advance. Stick
                    to your promises.
                </li>
                <li>When working with a client - their problems are your problems or at least that’s the way you should perceive
                    them. As an illustrator the relationship I build with the design team of a certain product should be
                    solid.
                </li>
                <li>Ask for feedback and give feedback in exchange. Transparency is key when building long lasting functioning
                    products.
                </li>
                <li>Don’t look at a good project as a lottery ticket, look at it as a longterm professional investment in your
                    portfolio and extract from it more than just payment and social media likes. Working on diverse projects
                    extends your general understanding of what your work could be useful for.</li>
                <li>Work with people who respect what you do as equally as they respect any other feature of the work process
                    their product goes through. What I mean by that is value your work and get a bullshit radar for people
                    that might consider illustrations and design as secondary.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="blogQuestion">What’s your favourite movie?</p>
            <p class="blogCopy">The Grand Budapest Hotel - I really like the fast pacing and aesthetically pleasing scenes of Wes Anderson’s
                movies. They make you think, laugh and just enjoy the most amazing colour palette sources you could ever
                find.
            </p>
            <img class="blogImage" src="images/diana-budapest.png">
            <p class="blogQuestion">What's your favourite book?</p>
            <p class="blogCopy">Not sure if I have one, but the one that left a permanent mark on my mind must be ’1984’. Very applicable till
                this day. I’m a fan of social dystopian works.</p>
            <p class="blogQuestion">What advice would you give to people that start out with Illustration?</p>
            <p class="blogCopy">Being a stubborn egocentric artist doesn’t set you off on a good start if you want to be a professional. Get
                over your ego, your insecurities, your fear and just go out there. Nothing just magically makes you good
                or successful. Invest in yourself, set your priorities straight in a way that after a couple of years you
                could look back at yourself and think “Well I really sacrificed going out for a few drinks after work or
                scrolling aimlessly through social media for hours, but what I have achieved is much more important than
                those short term acts of enjoyment.’’ I promise you that investing in yourself now would never influence
                you badly. Don’t wait for someone to motivate you, don’t wait for inspiration, you must be your own mentor.</p>
            <img class="blogImage" src="images/diana-dinosaurs.png">
            <p class="blogQuestion">Have you ever thought of empowering your creative community in any way, shape or form?</p>
            <p class="blogCopy">I’ve been a part of a creative community called Fill and Stoke that focuses on creating events where professionals
                and enthusiasts in the design community could share their working process, their tips and tricks and ask
                whatever questions they have about being and working as a creator.
